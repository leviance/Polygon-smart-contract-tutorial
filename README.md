# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
# compile smart contract code.
npx hardhat compile

# deploy smart contract just compiled on test net.
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network mumbai

#update CONTRACT_ADDRESS with new value in last run.

# interact with smart contract we just deploy.
npx hardhat run scripts/interact.js
```
